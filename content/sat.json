The text indicates that some researchers believe “Bronze Age societies were ruled by men.” But the Bronze Age burial of a woman at El Algar included “valuable objects signaling a high position of power,” which would raise the possibility that “women may have also held leadership roles.” Thus, the text is calling into question the notion that only men were leaders in these societies and speculating that people holding this view may reconsider their opinion.","correct_answer":"B"}},{"id":"885w32","domain":"Information and Ideas","question":{"choices":{"A":"Yes, because there was a 3% increase in household chemical injuries from November to December.","B":"Yes, because there were more household chemical injuries in December than in November.","C":"No, because there is no significant difference in the household chemical injury rates between November and December.","D":"No, because the data only show the total number of wounds treated in each month, not the specific types of injuries."},"question":"Is the data enough to prove there was an increase of household chemical injuries from November to December?","paragraph":"Of the 1000 wounds treated at the clinic in November, 22% involved a household chemical.

In November, 22% of the 1000 wounds (220 wounds) involved a household chemical. In December, 25% of the 400 wounds (100 wounds) involved a household chemical. 220 is not significantly different from 100.

The text indicates that scholars used to believe that during the Classic period, the Maya civilization didn’t have agricultural marketplaces. According to the text, scholars held this view because they misunderstood the ecology of areas where the Maya lived. The text points out that people tend to create marketplaces in order to acquire resources they don’t otherwise control. Agricultural marketplaces would have allowed farmers who produced one type of crop to trade that crop for other types of crops that they didn’t produce. The text goes on to say, however, that scholars underestimated the ecological diversity of the Maya areas, meaning that scholars thought that the Maya landscape produced a smaller range of resources than it actually produced. Taken together, then, this information suggests that scholars assumed that marketplaces wouldn’t have allowed Maya people to acquire products different from the products they already produced: that is, if everyone produced the same array of crops, as scholars mistakenly believed, then there wouldn’t have been any need for marketplaces where people could trade those crops.","correct_answer":"C"}},{"id":"856b495d","domain":"Standard English Conventions","question":{"choices":{"A":"musicians introduced audiences","B":"musicians’ introduced audiences’","C":"musician’s introduced audience’s","D":"musicians’ introduced audiences"},"question":"Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?","paragraph":"In the early twentieth century, Joseph K ekuku and other Hawaiian ______  in the mainland United S tates to the bright and\nlilting sound of the kīkā kila , or Hawaiian steel guitar.

The craft the team ultimately designed can fly on Mars because its blades are longer and rotate faster than those of a helicopter of the same size built for Earth.","explanation":"Choice A is the best answer because it presents an explanation about a helicopter that is directly supported by the text. The text states that Mars’s atmosphere is much less dense than Earth’s, and as a result, the air on Mars doesn’t provide the resistance required to support the blades of a helicopter built for Earth and to keep the helicopter aloft.

Choice A is a valid criticism because a small sample size can make it difficult to generalize the results to a larger population. Choice C is a valid criticism because random assignment is essential for ensuring that the two groups are comparable at the start of the experiment. Choice D is a valid criticism because it is important to control for all potential confounding variables that could explain the results.

The Nabataeans used their knowledge of water management to create a sophisticated irrigation system, which allowed them to grow crops and raise animals in the desert. They also built elaborate temples and tombs, carved into the sheer rock faces of the surrounding mountains. Petra's architectural achievements are renowned for their beauty and ingenuity. In the 2nd century AD, Petra became part of the Roman Empire and continued to prosper as a trading hub.

The convention being tested is punctuation use between sentences. In this choice, the period is used correctly to mark the boundary between one sentence (“However...sooner”) and another (“In...area”). The supplementary phrase “in 1425 CE” modifies “humans,” the subject of the third sentence. Choice B is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. A comma can’t be used in this way to mark the boundary between sentences. Choice C is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. A comma can’t be used in this way to mark the boundary between sentences. Moreover, the subordinating conjunction “which” creates a confusing and illogical sentence that suggests that the supplementary phrase beginning with “in” modifies the previous information (“However...sooner”) rather than the information that follows.

Celina Suarez, Alberto Pérez-Huerta, and T. Lynn Harrell Jr. examined oxygen-18 isotopes in mosasaur tooth enamel in order to calculate likely mosasaur body temperatures and determined that mosasaurs were endothermic—that is, they used internal metabolic processes to maintain a stable body temperature in a variety of ambient temperatures. Suarez, Pérez-Huerta, and Harrell claim that endothermy would have enabled mosasaurs to include relatively cold polar waters in their range.","explanation":"Choice C is the best answer because it presents the finding that, if true, would best support Suarez, Pérez-Huerta, and Harrell’s claim about mosasaurs. The text states that Suarez, Pérez-Huerta, and Harrell’s research on mosasaur tooth enamel led them to conclude that mosasaurs were endothermic, which means that they could live in waters at many different temperatures and still maintain a stable body temperature. The researchers claim that endothermy enabled mosasaurs to live in relatively cold waters near the poles. If several mosasaur fossils have been found in areas that were near the poles during the period when mosasaurs were alive and fossils of nonendothermic marine mammals are rare in such locations, that would support the researchers’ claim: it would show that mosasaurs inhabited polar waters but nonendothermic marine mammals tended not to, suggesting that endothermy may have been the characteristic that enabled mosasaurs to include polar waters in their range.","correct_answer":"C"}},{"id":"dd428136","domain":"Standard English Conventions","question":{"choices":{"A":"grain’s physical properties’","B":"grains’ physical properties","C":"grains’ physical property’s","D":"grains physical properties"},"question":"Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?","paragraph":"Cheng Dang and her colleagues at the University of Washington recently ran simulations to determine the extent to which individual snow ______ affect the amount of light reflecting off a snowy surface.","explanation":"Choice B is the best answer.

The density of ice is 900 kgm^3 and the density of the water is 1026 kgm^3. What is the volume of the portion of the iceberg that is submerged in the water?","explanation":"The buoyant force on the iceberg is equal to the weight of the water displaced by the submerged portion of the iceberg. The buoyant force is given by: F_b = ρ_w * V_s * g, where ρ_w is the density of the water, V_s is the volume of the submerged portion of the iceberg, and g is the acceleration due to gravity. The weight of the submerged portion of the iceberg is given by: F_g = ρ_i * V_s * g, where ρ_i is the density of the ice. Since the iceberg is floating, the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the submerged portion, so we have: F_b = F_g. This gives us: ρ_w * V_s * g = ρ_i * V_s * g. Dividing both sides by ρ_i * g, we get: V_s = ρ_w  ρ_i * V_s. Substituting the given values, we get: V_s = (1026 kgm^3)  (900 kgm^3) * V_s = 1.14 * V_s.

As used in this context, “repudiates” means rejects or refuses to have anything to do with. The text indicates that television shows tend to depict Native characters as living long ago, but that Harjo’s series Reservation Dogs focuses on Native teenagers in the present day, representing a “rejection” of the typical approach to depicting Native characters. This context thus indicates that Harjo repudiates television’s general tendency regarding Native characters. \nChoice B is incorrect because the text describes Harjo’s “rejection” of the typical approach to representing Native characters on television, so it wouldn’t make sense to say that Harjo “proclaims,” or declares or affirms, television’s general tendency regarding Native characters. Harjo is described as refusing to follow the pattern of depicting Native characters in the distant past, not as proclaiming that pattern. Choice C is incorrect because the text describes television’s tendency to represent Native characters in the distant past as something that is already occurring, not as something that Harjo “foretells,” or predicts will happen in the future. The text is focused on Harjo’s “rejection” of this pattern, not on any predictions he may have about it. Choice D is incorrect because saying that Harjo “recants” something would mean that he withdraws a previously held belief, and it wouldn’t make sense to say that Harjo recants television’s tendency to represent Native characters as living in the past. No beliefs previously held by Harjo are mentioned.

The dark blues and purples of the night sky contrast with the bright yellows and oranges of the stars and moon, drawing the viewer’s eye to the center of the canvas. The contrast between the sharp, angular lines of the cypress tree and the swirling, fluid lines of the stars and clouds further adds to this sense of tension.","explanation":"The contrast between the sharp, angular lines of the cypress tree and the swirling, fluid lines of the stars and clouds adds to the sense of tension in the painting. This is because the sharp lines of the tree create a sense of stability and order, while the swirling lines of the stars and clouds create a sense of movement and chaos.

The passage states that the butterfly population also declined in other regions of the United States where the parasitic wasps were not present, and that the decline in the butterfly population was more significant in the areas where the parasitic wasps were present. These facts suggest that the parasitic wasps are not entirely responsible for the decline in the butterfly population. However, the passage does not state that the decline in the butterfly population was not as significant in the areas where the parasitic wasps were not present.

Texas was so distant from population centers in Spain’s other colonies that it attracted ____ colonists after its initial colonization. Geographical isolation in turn would have limited the exposure of Texan colonists to changes occurring to Spanish grammar and vocabulary elsewhere in the empire. Thus, the present-day uniqueness of the Texan dialect suggests the extent to which ______","explanation":"Choice A is the best answer because it is the choice that most logically completes the text. The text mentions a dialect of Spanish spoken in Texas, which was colonized by Spain in the 1500s. The text then states that the Texan dialect differs from other Spanish dialects in that it still has characteristics of an older Spanish that other dialects eventually lost. After asking why this might be, the text points out that the Texas colony was distant from Spain’s other colonies, making it less attractive to colonists after the initial colonization. This geographic isolation limited the colony’s exposure to other Spanish colonists who would have otherwise introduced the changes to the Spanish language that occurred in their respective colonies. It can therefore be inferred that this isolation is a reason why the Texan dialect still has characteristics of an older Spanish, while the Spanish dialects spoken in less isolated areas that have more interaction with speakers of other dialects would lose those characteristics over time.

As used in this context, “interpret” would mean decipher the meaning of. The text indicates that Dickinson’s poems have many unusual features, that it’s difficult to tell what exactly the poems’ subject matter is, and that scholars strongly disagree about the poems. This context conveys the idea that it’s difficult to interpret Dickinson’s poems.\nChoice A is incorrect because “delegate” means to assign someone as a representative of another person or to entrust something to someone else, neither of which would make sense in context.

Choice B is incorrect because describing Dickinson’s poems as difficult to “compose,” or put together or produce, would make sense only if the text were about Dickinson’s experience of writing the poems. It could be true that it was difficult for Dickinson to compose her poems, but the text doesn’t address this; it instead discusses how readers interpret and engage with the poems.\nChoice D is incorrect because describing Dickinson’s poems as being difficult to “renounce,” or give up or refuse, wouldn’t make sense in context. The text focuses on the idea that features of Dickinson’s poems are odd or unclear and have caused heated scholarly debate.

As used in this context, “a substantial” effect means an effect that is sizeable or noteworthy. The text indicates that the researchers are seeking to determine whether there are “considerable variations” in the potency of stingray venom that are associated with variation in the stingrays’ age and sex. This context suggests that the researchers want to find out whether stingray age and sex have a substantial effect on venom toxicity. \n\nChoice A is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text that suggests that the researchers have been studying whether the stingrays’ age and sex have “a disconcerting,” or an unsettling and disturbing, effect on the stingrays’ venom. The text indicates that the researchers wish to determine if stingray age and sex cause large variations in the toxicity of stingray venom, not if the effect of age and sex is disconcerting. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that researchers want to find out whether differences in stingray age and sex produce differences in stingray venom, not that the researchers want to find out whether age and sex have “an acceptable,” or a satisfactory, effect on venom. The text makes no mention of what would make an effect on venom toxicity acceptable and gives no indication that the researchers are interested in that question. Choice C is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context for the researchers to be looking for “an imperceptible,” or an unnoticeable, effect of age and sex on stingray venom.
